# Project Name

Week 5 with Technigo Boot Camp and third individual project overall. Assignment was to understand the pre-made code and create a functioning game.

## The problem

I planned the project by writing down what I wanted each step to be.
I used some of the Javascript techniques that I'd read about in the course material. I also googled and used Stackoverflow to look for answers.
I added some counters to the project, one to keep track of the questions asked and two to keep track on win or lose statistics.

If I had more time I would have added a timer and also focused on the styling of the project.
